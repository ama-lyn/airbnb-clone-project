# AirBnB Clone Project

## Project Overview 
This project is a full-stack clone of the AirBnB platform, designed to replicate the core functionalities of the popular vacation rental service. **AirBnB** is a global platform that connects travelers with hosts offering unique accommodations, ranging from apartments and houses to boutique hotels and more.

The **goal of this project** is to create a functional web application where users can **explore property listings**, view **detailed descriptions and photos**, and **make bookings seamlessly**. It also aims to provide hosts with tools to **list their properties** and **manage reservations**. By building this clone, I aim to deepen my understanding of **modern web development practices**, including **responsive design**, **state management**, and **backend integration**.
